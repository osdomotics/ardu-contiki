Arduino compatibility example
=============================

make clean TARGET=osd-merkur-256 flash

This example shows that it is now possible to re-use arduino sketches in
Contiki. This example documents the necessary magic. Arduino specifies
two routines, `setup` and `loop`. Before `setup` is called, the
framework initializes hardware. In original Arduino, all this is done in
a `main` function (in C). For contiki we define a process that does the
same.
