    this is intended to be as error-tolerant as possible. if you don't supply
    a mode, the default mode will be 'easy'. the sensitivity obviously defaults
    to 1.0 (byte value of 69). Default address selection is LOW, which is how
    the BH1750FVI should default if you don't connect anything to its ADDR pin.

    This is probably all you wanted from this library. Return value is an
    unsigned 16 bit integer with units of Lux. There are three possible modes:
    'r' raw numerical reading, no units, you get what you get
    'c' convert units to Lux or half-Lux, depending on the mode, but don't
        compensate for the sensitivity setting. This allows sensitivity to
        be used as enclosure optics calibration/compensation.

    Return value of this start function is the delay time between refreshes of
    the ambient light reading. After you call this function, you can use getLightLevel()
    to read the most recent ambient light level. If you try to run this ongoing start
    function with a one-time mode argument, it will do nothing and return 0.

    Return value of this start function is the delay time before the new ambient
    light reading will be available. You can check whether the new sample is ready
    yet using sampleIsFresh(). Retrieve that single sample with getLightLevel().
    If you give this one-time start function a continuous mode argument, it will
    do nothing and return 0.
  */word startSingleSample(char mode=BH_NoMod);

  /*SENSITIVITY SETTINGS
    This function lets you change the 'sensitivity' of the BH1750FVI by changing
    its sampling time up or down. The sensitivity is stored as a number between
    31 and 254, with a default value of 69. This is intended to compensate for
    having the chip installed in an enclosure that blocks some ambient light.
    The floating point versions of the function allow the sensitivity to be
    given as a ratio between ~0.45 and ~3.68. The return value is the number of
    milliseconds that the chip will take to create a new light level reading.

    In case you want to turn off the BH1750FVI to save power. Other commands will wake
    the chip back up. Single sample modes automatically turn off the chip after sampling,
    but you can still read the value from it without waking it up.
